**Introduction**
Some ornamental plants require specific temperature, humidity, soil moisture, PH level
and light for their growth. Due to the changing environment in Pakistan, plants are not
grown well.
For this, we build a solution and try to provide an Ideal environment for the growth of the
ornamental plants by placing the plants in the house. Instructions are given to the house
by a web application, then microcontroller proceeds according to those instructions. For
the monitoring of the house and data visualization the mobile application will be
developed.
**Purpose**
The Intelligent Greenhouse system will try to create the ideal environment from every
aspect for plants along with live streaming of greenhouse. We will make the Web Portal
for the creation of plant lifecycle information; this information can be self-entered by the
user and start session into the Greenhouse and also deals with more than one user. The
Mobile App is actually for monitoring the greenhouse by live streaming and by
parameters details, to check from everywhere what is going on in Greenhouse without
visit. Hardware System executes according to the plant lifecycle which is saved by the
client through a web portal and also saves the current parameters values in the database.
